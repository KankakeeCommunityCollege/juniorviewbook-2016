        <h3>Save money!</h3>
        <p>
          KCC is affordable. Tuition and fees are about one-fourth the cost
          of Illinois public colleges or universities, and a fraction of the cost
          of private universities.
        </p>
        <h3>Save time!</h3>
        <p>
          Trim your college course load and make it easier to maintain
          a high GPA in college.
